# Fragrance Recommendation System

## Problem Statement
E-commerce makes up an increasing percentage of retail sales every year, indicating a shift in consumer purchasing habits from in-store shopping to online shopping. Some industries, however, face unique challenges in setting up a digital platform to sell their products and services. One such market is the fragrance market. Buying perfumes online is difficult because there is no way for consumers to truly test the product before they purchase it, which prevents online retailers from maximizing sales from online shopping. 

Currently, consumers rely on the following methods to inform their purchases of perfumes online:

1. Social media influence: Influencers on popular social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest promote various brands. Perfumes that go viral on social media tend to be purchased more frequently. The problem with this method is that it lacks transparency and individuality. Influencers often collaborate with brands, which would make their recommendations biased. Opinions about fragrance are also very subjective, since preferences vary from person to person, even for the same scent. 
2. Customer reviews: People might turn to customer reviews, either on the online retailer’s platform or on forums such as Reddit, to understand whether they would like a perfume before purchasing it online. The problem with this method, once again, is that preferences are subjective. Additionally, consumer descriptions tend to be too binary, in that they either say they liked or disliked a fragrance with little to no further information about why.
3. Online scent-matching quizzes: Some brands offer online quizzes that ask consumers about their preferences (e.g., floral, citrus, musky) and then recommend perfumes accordingly. While these might yield more accurate recommendations, they can still be prone to brand bias and seem very generic. 

There is a need for a more unbiased, personalized, and nuanced way for consumers to inform themselves about fragrances they are interested in purchasing online. 

## Stakeholders

1. Online Retailers: If consumers are more confident that they will like the perfume they are purchasing online, they will be more likely to buy it. Increased consumer confidence with less worry about having to return a product will increase online sales for the retailer.
2. Consumers: If consumers had a way to know they would like a fragrance without needing to physically test it, it would make their shopping experience more convenient and less time-consuming. In addition, they can also evaluate whether a fragrance matches the preferences of a friend or family member, which solves the subjectivity problem as well.
